Description
------------
These are example code listings for the PhotoDissociation Region Toolbox
(https://dustem.astro.umd.edu), and companion to the manuscript "The
PhotoDissociation Region Toolbox: Software and Models for Astrophysical
Analysis", by Pound & Wolfire (2022).  These code snippets show typical ways
to use the Toolbox and reproduce most of the figures in the manuscript.
The code is written in Python 3 and demonstrate the pdrtpy Python package
(https://pdrtpy.readthedocs.io).  The examples required installation of
pdrtpy (pip install pdrtpy).
